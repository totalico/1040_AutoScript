This file contains all your information that are supposed to be calculated
and processed by IRS in 1040. all the information is on your station, so no
one can take any advantages from this file.
There are few section:
personal info - your family and you, input names and ssn.

#  Principals

2. NOTE! You need to check all the checkboxes, till we improve to do that automatically.
